# Mobile Banking Application (JavaScript)

## 📱 Overview

The Mobile Banking Application is a simple, browser-based banking simulation developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Its purpose is to demonstrate the core concepts of programming, including data structures, functions, and user interface updates, while simulating real-world banking operations.

This project is designed for learners and developers who want to practice JavaScript fundamentals and understand how basic banking operations—like logging in, viewing transactions, and transferring money can be implemented programmatically.
## 👥 User Accounts

The application includes **four demo accounts**, each with a **username** and a **PIN**:

| Owner  | Username | PIN  |
| ------ | -------- | ---- |
| User 1 | js       | 1111 |
| User 2 | js       | 2222 |
| User 3 | stw      | 3333 |
| User 4 | ss       | 4444 |

> ⚠️ *All accounts are for demonstration only — no real authentication.*

## 🧩 Features

* 🔐 **Login system** using username + PIN
* 💸 **Transfer money** between demo accounts
* 📊 **Display account movements** (transactions)
* 🔁 **Update UI automatically** after transfers

# Separate Description

This project demonstrates a **beginner-friendly mobile banking simulation** built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**. It focuses on using **arrays** to store account data and **functions** to perform banking operations such as login and money transfers. The system includes four sample accounts with predefined usernames and PINs. The main goal of the project is to help learners practice core JavaScript concepts without any external libraries or frameworks.
