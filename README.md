# Mobile Banking Application (JavaScript)

## 📱 Overview

This project is a simple **Mobile Banking Application** built using **plain JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It was developed for **learning purposes**, mainly to practice working with **arrays**, **functions**, and **basic DOM manipulation**.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Understand how to structure data using **arrays**
* Use **functions** to perform operations such as login, transferring money, and updating account data
* Practice core JavaScript logic without relying on frameworks
* Apply basic **frontend design** with HTML & CSS

## 👥 User Accounts

The application includes **four demo accounts**, each with a **username** and a **PIN**:

| Owner  | Username | PIN  |
| ------ | -------- | ---- |
| User 1 | js       | 1111 |
| User 2 | js       | 2222 |
| User 3 | stw      | 3333 |
| User 4 | ss       | 4444 |

> ⚠️ *All accounts are for demonstration only — no real authentication.*

## 🧩 Features

* 🔐 **Login system** using username + PIN
* 💸 **Transfer money** between demo accounts
* 📊 **Display account movements** (transactions)
* 🔁 **Update UI automatically** after transfers

# Separate Description

This project demonstrates a **beginner-friendly mobile banking simulation** built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**. It focuses on using **arrays** to store account data and **functions** to perform banking operations such as login and money transfers. The system includes four sample accounts with predefined usernames and PINs. The main goal of the project is to help learners practice core JavaScript concepts without any external libraries or frameworks.
